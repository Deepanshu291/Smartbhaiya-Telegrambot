## **Installation Guide**

### 1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deepanshu291/Smartbhaiya-Telegrambot.git
cd Smartbhaiya-Telegrambot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:

SmartBhaiya Bot uses **`aiogram`** to interact with the Telegram API, so youâ€™ll need to install the required Python packages.

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, install the dependencies manually:

```bash
pip install aiogram asyncio
```

### 3. Set Up Your Bot Token:

- Replace the **`YOUR_BOT_TOKEN`** in the code with your actual bot token from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).
- Open the file `config.py` (or wherever your bot token is stored) and update the token.

```python
TOKEN = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'  # Replace with your Telegram Bot Token
```
